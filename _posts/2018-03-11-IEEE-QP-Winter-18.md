The <b>Get Posturized</b> is a prototype device that helps correct unhealthy posture and alleviates their negative effects. It uses a gyroscope to detect the optimal position relative to the body posture. 

## How to Use
 * Using a t-shirt with pockets, preferably, put the Arduino side of the device into the pocket.
 * Tape the other end of the device over the shoulder onto the back of your shoulder blades.
 * Open up the Android App and connect your phone to the Bluetooth module on the device.
 * Stand straight and start caliberating your ideal posture on the app.
 * Afterwards, the device will vibrate whenever you lean to far forwards or backwards from the ideal posture and the app will notify you      of the incorrect posture.
