This is the official launch of my personal portfolio website that I created during my time of curiosity and bored-ness. There is still alot of things to do for the website so it looks less empty but feel free to take a look! Thanks!

## Goals for this Website

 * Keep updating this site
 * Move to a new domain if I am able in the future
 * Makes some posts from time to time
 * Anything else I think of will be added later on
