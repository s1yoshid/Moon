## UCSD Affiliated Sites
**IEEE UCSD Home Page**  
UCSD is home to the San Diego IEEE organization which provides many opportunities to students at UCSD and in the larger STEM community. I had the opportunity to participate in the organization over a few quarters and taught me many things outside of classes. I had the chance to work on a project in a team during a quarter and meet many people who were very passionate about engineering.
